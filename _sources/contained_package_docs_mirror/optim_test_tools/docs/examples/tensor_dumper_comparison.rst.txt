Tensor Dumper – Comparison Example
==================================

Start here for the tensor dumper. This example shows how to enable the dumper, dump tensors,
and compare a subsequent run against a stored reference. The :doc:`tensor_dumper_dumping` example shows 
more features (custom converters, per‑tensor overrides, RaggedBatch support, custom pre‑dump processing, 
early exit).

.. seealso::
    
    The code of this example can be found in the repository under 
    ``packages/optim_test_tools/examples/tensor_dumper_comparison_example.py``.

Overview
--------

- Enable the dumper and choose dump location.
- Dump data in one run; compare in a later run (or next loop iteration here for demonstration).
- Override dump formats to JSON for comparison (comparison supports only JSON).
- Gradients are auto-computed when you call ``set_gradients([...])`` with scalar losses. These gradients are
  only used for dumping/comparison and do not influence the gradients computed elsewhere (e.g. during 
  training).

Example
-------

.. important::

   In this example, we do not divide the code into different parts which correspond to e.g. different source
   files in the actual use case, to make the example more concise. However, as 
   :class:`~accvlab.optim_test_tools.TensorDumper` is a singleton, this can be easily done in practice. 
   Please see the :doc:`stopwatch` or the :doc:`nvtx_range_wrapper` for examples of how to do this. The same 
   approach can be used with the :class:`~accvlab.optim_test_tools.TensorDumper`.

Output
^^^^^^

Here, we show example output (for the test configuration as set in the example code).

There are two warnings, one for the tensors and one for the gradients.

Tensor Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that 
  - The number of numerical errors is limited per tensor. This is controlled by the 
    ``num_errors_per_tensor_to_show`` parameter and used to prevent the output from being too verbose (e.g.
    when comparing large tensors such as images)
  - Apart from the numerical errors, there are also mismatch errors for missing/extra keys. Missing keys may
    be allowed (configurable). This option may be useful when the current data is based on an implementation 
    in progress, so that some of the data is not yet available.
  - Instead of displaying warnings, an error can be raised instead by setting the ``as_warning`` parameter to 
    ``False``.

Gradients
~~~~~~~~~

The comparison of gradients is analogous to the comparison of tensors. In this example, only numerical errors 
are present.
