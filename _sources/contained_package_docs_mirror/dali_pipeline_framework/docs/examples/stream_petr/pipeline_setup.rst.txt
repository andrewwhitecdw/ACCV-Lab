StreamPETR Pipeline Setup
=========================

This page documents the DALI-based StreamPETR training pipeline as implemented in
``examples/pipeline_setup/stream_petr_pipeline.py``.

Overview and Goals
------------------

.. module-docstring:: ../../../examples/pipeline_setup/stream_petr_pipeline.py

.. important::

   The pipeline described here is designed as a drop-in replacement for the PyTorch DataLoader
   which can be used for the training of the 
   `original StreamPETR implementation <https://github.com/exiawsh/StreamPETR>`_ in the 
   **streaming video training mode** (``seq_mode=True``).
   Therefore, we implement the pipeline in a way that the final output data structure (of the 
   :class:`~accvlab.dali_pipeline_framework.pipeline.DALIStructuredOutputIterator` object wrapping the 
   pipeline) is compatible with the output data structure of the PyTorch DataLoader in the original 
   implementation and contains all the data needed for training in the expected format.

Details
-------

Here, we discuss the details of the ``StreamPETR`` pipeline setup.

Input Data Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, we use a :class:`~accvlab.dali_pipeline_framework.inputs.SequenceSampler` to load sequence-based data.
When loading the data, we also perform some simple high-level pre-processing of the metadata, such as scene 
filtering and sequence splitting.

See the :doc:`../2d_object_detection/pipeline_setup` for general input callable mechanics as well as 
sharding/shuffling.

Define Processing Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, we define the pre-processing steps that will be applied to the input data.

The processing is more involved than in the :doc:`../2d_object_detection/pipeline_setup`. Please see the 
code below, and refer to :doc:`../2d_object_detection/pipeline_setup` for more details on some of the steps. 

Also note that this pipeline uses a custom step to combine and format the data to a format close to StreamPETR 
training expectations; see :doc:`custom_processing_step` for details.

Pipeline Definition & Output Data Format

Wiring the input implementation with the steps and capturing the output data structure blueprint.

Create and Build the DALI Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Seed setup for augmentation reproducibility, pipeline creation, and build. See the 
:doc:`../2d_object_detection/pipeline_setup` for more background on these steps.

   :end-before: # ===== Wrap as iterator =====

Wrap as Structured Iterator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pipeline is wrapped as a ``DALIStructuredOutputIterator``. A post-processing function aligns the
output format to the structures expected by StreamPETR training.

The implementation uses
:meth:`~accvlab.dali_pipeline_framework.pipeline.DALIStructuredOutputIterator.CreateAsDataLoaderObject` so that
the returned iterator is also recognized by ``isinstance(..., DataLoader)`` checks in training code expecting a
PyTorch ``DataLoader``.

For detail on the post-processing function, see :doc:`custom_post_processing`.
